# RedactionService

* The application is an ASP.NET Core Web API built using Visual Studio 2022.
* The application utilises Swagger to test the end points.
* F6 will build the application and Ctrl+F5 will run the application and load the swagger screen in a browser. The end points can also be tested in Postman.
* The application took around 3 hours in total to complete.

* The port the service presents on *should be configurable at runtime*, that is you should be able to start the application to run on a defined port.
* I was not sure about this requirement, I know the url/port can be set in the launchSettings.json file which will determine the port the api runs on so believe this is sufficient.
